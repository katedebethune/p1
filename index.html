	Summary: this site will provide a web presence to support the marketing of a new cafe. The cafe will also offer a catering menu, with online ordering.
	This site was built using PHP and the Laravel framework. It makes use of an elegant, responsive 1-page Bootstrap template, modified to include subpages for the catering application. 

    
    <h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do</h2>
    <p>I am currently a new stay-at-home mom and am really enjoying it! Until a few 
    months ago, I was the marketing director for Skinner Auctioneers
    and Appraisers where I led an initiative to <a href="http://sametz.com/work/skinner-auctioneers-appraisers/">rebrand the company</a> and a 
    major re-architecting of the <a href="http://www.skinnerinc.com">corporate web site</a>. The site work included 
    integration of new live and timed auction platforms, the migration of search functionality from 
    a brittle, SQL-powered search engine to SOLR, a
    more user-friendly information architecture, and mobile web. After launch, 
    unique and total visits doubled within the year.</p>
    <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
    <p>After so much time in project management roles related to web
    development, I wanted to get my hands dirty and take on some of 
    my own projects.</p>
    <h2>What previous programming experience do you have?</h2>
    <p>I've been chipping away at the cs curriculum at the Harvard
    Extension School for several years. I've taken e10a, e10b, e22, and e60. 
    I'm currently taking e15 and e26.</p>
    <p>In addition to pretty solid intermediate-level Java programming skills, 
    I've picked up some knowledge of Python, JavaScript, SQL, and noSQL tools and others on my own. 
    I'm learning c now in e26 and am loving it!
    I've had a lot of fun working through tutorials for some of the MVC-based web frameworks including
    NetBeans, Django, and RoR. I'm looking forward to learning Laravel.</p>
    <h2>Are you working on the Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
    <p>Mac. Specifically a Macbook Air using Mavericks (OSX 10.9.4)</p>
    <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
    <p>I am also a <a href="http://debethunecello.com">cellist</a>, hence the snippet from the facsimile of 
    the Prelude to the Sixth Bach Cello Suite at the top of the page.</p>
